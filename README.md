# OpenCV NumCpp Boost Template

** Special Thanks to David Pilger, and his extensive work on NumCpp, a C++ implementation of NumPy.

In order to get this working properly, you will need to setup your CMake through MinGW. I am using CLion,
but you could very easily just use the MinGW terminal.

You will need OpenCV, which can be quite tempermental. I also built that one with MinGW. 

Boost comes next. This one shouldn't be too bad, just follow their instructions.

Lastly is NumCpp. That's included, so you shouldn't have to do anything. 

I'll try to do a more formal write up, but for now this will be the shell of a template.
